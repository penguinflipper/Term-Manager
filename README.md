# Obsidian Term Definition Plugin

The Obsidian Term Definition Plugin is a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance your note-taking experience by allowing you to define and manage terms directly within your notes. With this plugin, you can easily highlight text, define terms, and store these definitions in a centralized "Definitions" note, keeping your notes organized and your terms easily accessible.

### Features

- Highlight and Define Terms: Simply highlight text in any of your notes and define it using the "Define Term" command.
- Auto-Creation of Definitions Note: The plugin automatically creates a "Definitions" note in your vault where all your term definitions are stored.
- Organized Definitions: Terms are stored alphabetically under appropriate alphabetical headings within the "Definitions" note, making it easy to find and reference them.
- Clear Term Definitions: If you need to remove a term's definition, you can do so using the "Clear Term Definition" command.
